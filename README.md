# Face-Recognisation-Using-Transfer-Learning
In this directory I have created a Face Recognisation Model using the concepts of Transfer Learning. I have created a real-time face detection system which can detect your face at real time and predict the accurcay too. In this Project I have used the concepts of transfer Learning and did a fine tuning to a pre-trained model. For detecting the face I have used LBPH Frontal Face haarClassifier.

# How to Run?
1. Open Jupyter Notebook<br>
2. Create your own dataset<br>
3. Run Model Creating notebook to create your own model<br>
4. Load the model Created and run Face Recognisation to detect the file.

<b>Note</b> : You might encounter some error in the Face Recognisation code. I am trying to solve these errors as soon as possible.
